defmodule Tirexs.Resources.APIs do
  @moduledoc """
  This module provides a set of API helpers. Helpers are useful for buiding
  an URN part of particular request. Most commonly the result of this would
  be used for dealing directly with variety of available `Tirexs.HTTP` functions.

  ## Examples:

      iex> APIs._refresh({ [force: true] })
      "_refresh?force=true"

      iex> APIs._refresh(["bear_test", "duck_test"], { [force: false] })
      "bear_test,duck_test/_refresh?force=false"

      iex> APIs._field_mapping(["bear_test", "duck_test"], "message", {[ ignore_unavailable: true ]})
      "bear_test,duck_test/_mapping/message/field?ignore_unavailable=true"

      iex> APIs._field_mapping("_all", "tw*", ["*.id", "*.text"])
      "_all/_mapping/tw*/field/*.id,*.text"

  NOTICE: All of helpers have the same interface, behaviour and almost don't care about the details.
  It means, you have a chance to create a complety unsupported API call.

  ## For instance:

      iex> APIs._refresh(["bear_test", "duck_test"], ["a", "b"], {[ human: true ]})
      "bear_test,duck_test/_refresh/a,b?human=true"


  A `Tirexs.Resources.urn/x` is responsible for concatenation parts all together.

  ## Feature requests

  Feature requests are welcome and should be discussed. But take a moment to find
  out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. Please provide
  as much detail and context as possible (from `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
